# Data structures and algorithms

Data structures and algorithms are some of the most essential topics for programmers, both to get a job and to do well on a job. Good knowledge of data structures and algorithms is the foundation of writing good code.

[Big O](https://github.com/hayk77/DataStructures-and-Algorithms/tree/master/Big%20O) notation is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity.

[Data Structure](https://github.com/hayk77/DataStructures-and-Algorithms/tree/master/DataStructures) is a way to store and organize data so that it can be used efficiently.

[An algorithm](https://github.com/hayk77/DataStructures-and-Algorithms/tree/master/Algorithms) is a well-defined procedure that allows a computer to solve a problem.

[Dynamic Programming](https://github.com/hayk77/DataStructures-and-Algorithms/tree/master/Dynamic%20Programming) is a method for solving a complex problem by breaking it down into a collection of simpler subproblems.
